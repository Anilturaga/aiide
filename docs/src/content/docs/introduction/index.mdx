AIIDE is a framework for developing highly capable LLM agents while being developer-friendly.

AIIDE focuses on the following aspects:
1. Tools should be able to scale from complex tasks(code interpreter) to nested agent interactions.
2. Agents generally work on a piece of data. ex: data transformation on a dataframe, editing a code file or editing images.
    * As the agent performs actions using tools, we produce versions of the data. These versions are called Environments in AIIDE. 
    * We pass a selected number of these versions of data(last 3 dataframes, current state of the code file) to the LLM as context.
3. An easy API for streaming will help build great user experiences.


## Get Started
There are couple of ways to get started with AIIDE:
